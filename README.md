# Autumn HTML Template

This is a responsive HTML-template that is dedicated to all those who want to build a website where green colors are welcome, such as on fantasy or fairy tale websites.

The HTML template is based on a WordPress theme which I built myself. Since someone asked me if I could build a static HTML-template based on it, I did this.

So you can use this calming and relaxing design on static websites or use it as a basis for a template on another CMS.

The template is as usable as it is, you don't have to install anything extra.

If you have any questions or need help, just let me know.
